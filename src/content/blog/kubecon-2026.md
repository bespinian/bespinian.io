## We're Heading to Amsterdam

**March 23-26, 2026** – We'll be packing our bags for Amsterdam. KubeCon +
CloudNativeCon Europe is back, and the bespinian team will be there.

This is where the cloud native community gathers. Thousands of engineers,
architects, and tech leaders meet to talk Kubernetes, share war stories, and
figure out what's next for cloud platforms.

### Topics We Want to Talk About

Come find us if you want to discuss:

- Moving legacy apps to Kubernetes without breaking everything
- Making the jump from on-premise servers to cloud platforms
- AWS and Azure migration challenges
- Building platforms that developers actually enjoy using
- Kubernetes security that doesn't slow teams down

### What's Catching Our Attention This Year

- How platform engineering is changing the way teams work
- AI tools that actually help with cloud operations
- New patterns for running stateful apps on Kubernetes
- Better ways to handle multi-cloud setups
- The latest from CNCF projects

### Our Team Will Be Around Amsterdam All Week

We're not just showing up for the keynotes. We'll be at talks, in the hallways,
and wherever good conversations about cloud tech are happening.

Want to meet? Send us a message and we'll find time for coffee.

### Why This Matters

Cloud migrations fail when companies try to figure everything out alone. They
succeed when there's someone in the room who has done it before and knows the
shortcuts.

That's why we go to KubeCon. To meet teams who are in the middle of their cloud
journey and share what we've learned from helping dozens of companies make the
same move.

### What We Believe In

**Why:** Every company should be able to use modern cloud technology. Moving to
Kubernetes, AWS, or Azure shouldn't feel like solving a puzzle with missing
pieces.

**How:** We work directly with your teams. No thick documents that sit on a
shelf. We solve problems together, teach as we go, and don't leave until your
apps run smoothly.

**What:** We're a software consulting company in Bern, Switzerland. We help you
move server apps to Kubernetes, AWS, and Azure.

See you in Amsterdam.
