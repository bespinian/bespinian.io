# Cloud Migration: What Mountains Can Teach Us About Digital Transformation

When I started my adventure with mountaineering, I've learned that reaching the
summit isn't about strength and technical details alone—it's about preparation,
mindset, strategy, and the right team. The same is true for cloud migration.
It’s crucial to split the work into phases, plan carefully, face changing
conditions and be among trustworthy people with the right skills and motivation.

Organizations that treat migration as a simple technical lift often struggle.
Those that approach it like an expedition—with careful planning, staged
progress, and expert guidance—reach their goals successfully and succeed in a
cloud environment.

## Preparation and planning

Every successful expedition starts with a detailed plan. Your cloud migration
should too:

- **Assess your landscape** - understanding current infrastructure and
  challenges are crucial for a successful migration plan. We need to know what
  problems we want to solve first.
- **Choose your path** - Choosing the right tools and models is crucial. Public,
  private, or hybrid cloud? Each has different implications for cost, control,
  and scalability
- **Define your strategy** - Draft out your path to the cloud and see what needs
  to be done Will you lift-and-shift for speed, re-platform for optimization, or
  refactor for maximum cloud-native benefits?

## Start the ascent

Mountaineers ascend gradually, allowing time to adapt. Apply the same approach
to your migration:

- **Migrate incrementally** - Move non-critical workloads first to build
  confidence and learn the terrain
- **Run parallel systems** - During the transition state, run the workloads in
  hybrid mode, gradually turning into cloud to minimize risks
- **Test and validate** - Prove the model works before committing critical
  operations

## Acclimatize to Your New Environment

Reaching altitude isn't enough—you need time to rest and adapt. In mountains, we
need to optimize how our body reacts for less oxygen. With migration, we need to
adapt to the new cloud environment. Once your first workloads are in the cloud,
it’s time to optimize.

- **Optimize performance** - Now that you have your workloads in the cloud, you
  can dig deeper into how to make them more efficient and tune them accordingly.
  Revise your services and their possibilities.
- **Strengthen security** - Used to have everything locked in your on-premise
  world, you have to realize what threats await you in the cloud world. But
  there is nothing to worry about, with the implementation of best practices,
  cloud-specific security controls and compliance measures you can reach the
  secure environment.
- **Control costs** - We can just move everything to the cloud and make it work,
  but to reach efficiency and a reasonable end-of-month bill from our provider,
  the setup requires a closer look. Automation is crucial here, as well as
  getting the benefits of the cloud pay-as-you-go model.

## Navigate the Final Ascent

The summit push requires focus. This migration step also requires special
attention to details and can bring new challenges.

- **Build resilience** - Your services are overall stable, however we need to
  prepare for surprises like, for example, service downtime. Make sure you align
  with redundancy strategies and keep your resources highly available.
- **Monitoring and scaling** - Real-time visibility into performance and costs
  is essential for your success as well as scalable archotecture.
- **Continuously refine** - to gain as much benefit from your migration as
  possible, refine regularly your cloud environment and explore deeper the
  possibilities the cloud gives you.

## Enjoy the views!

After months of hard work, you finally reached your goal and are standing on the
top of a high mountain with your head in the clouds. The feeling of great
achievement is great.

Successfully migrated organizations report faster time-to-market, improved
scalability, and reduced infrastructure overhead. But these benefits require
commitment to the journey—not just reaching the cloud, but optimizing
continuously once there.
