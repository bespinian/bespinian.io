  "The collaboration with bespinian was smooth, committed, and remarkably fast.
  Their ability to understand our challenges and move immediately into action —
  even when timelines were tight — made all the difference. This is exactly the
  type of partnership we look for to move forward quickly, in a sustainable and
  pragmatic way."

## Customer

[TALK](https://talk.swiss/en/) is a Swiss technology company based in the canton
of Neuchâtel that develops an AI-powered platform for improving oral
communication skills. Their mobile application analyzes speeches across verbal,
paraverbal, and non-verbal dimensions, providing users with objective feedback
on message quality, voice, and emotional expression. Certified by Swiss Made
Software, TALK serves enterprise customers, including banks, insurance
companies, and large corporations, helping teams develop impactful communication
skills through a combination of AI technology and expert coaching.

## Background

As TALK experienced growing demand for their platform, they needed to ensure
their infrastructure could scale reliably while maintaining the security and
performance their enterprise customers expect. The platform runs on Cloud
Platform (GCP) in Switzerland, using Kubernetes Engine (GKE), and processes
sensitive video and audio data that require robust security measures and high
availability.

TALK sought an external assessment of their infrastructure to identify areas for
improvement and gain confidence that their setup followed cloud-native best
practices. They needed a partner with deep Kubernetes expertise who could not
only identify issues but also work collaboratively with their teams to implement
pragmatic and sustainable improvements.

## Project Goals

The engagement aimed to achieve the following objectives:

- Conduct a comprehensive assessment of the existing GKE infrastructure
- Identify gaps in security, scalability, and operational efficiency
- Provide actionable recommendations prioritized by impact
- Implement improvements collaboratively with the TALK team
- Improve infrastructure efficiency, sustainability, and long-term
  maintainability while strengthening reliability

## bespinian's Role

bespinian delivered a structured assessment and implementation engagement that
strengthened TALK’s infrastructure posture and operational confidence.

### Infrastructure Assessment Workshop

An initial workshop was conducted to thoroughly assess TALK’s GCP and GKE setup.
This included reviewing cluster configuration, networking, security policies,
deployment patterns, and operational procedures. The workshop provided immediate
visibility into the infrastructure’s strengths and improvement areas.

### Detailed Improvement Roadmap

Following the assessment, bespinian delivered a comprehensive report with a
prioritized list of improvements. Each recommendation included its rationale,
expected impact, and implementation approach, enabling informed and strategic
decision-making.

### Load Testing

Load testing was implemented to better understand platform behavior under stress
and identify potential bottlenecks. This provided concrete data on system
behavior as user numbers grow and helped validate subsequent optimizations.

### Robustness and Scalability Improvements

Working closely with the TALK team, bespinian enhanced the resilience of
applications running on GKE. This included implementing appropriate resource
requests and limits, configuring horizontal pod autoscaling, improving health
checks, and ensuring graceful handling of pod disruptions.

### Security Hardening

The overall security posture of the infrastructure was reinforced. This covered
network policies, pod security standards, secrets management, and access
controls, ensuring the platform meets the stringent requirements of enterprise
customers handling sensitive communication data.

### Simplification and Efficiency Gains

Opportunities were identified to simplify the infrastructure and optimize
resource usage. These improvements reduced unnecessary complexity, improved
operational clarity, and supported a more sustainable and responsible use of
cloud resources over time.
