## Customer

[amaise](https://www.amaise.com/) is a Bern-based insurtech company that has
developed an AI-powered claims intelligence platform for the insurance industry.
The platform helps insurers resolve bodily injury claims faster, more
accurately, and at lower cost by analyzing complete case files, not just medical
records. amaise's agentic AI technology turns unstructured medical and legal
documents into actionable insights, enabling claims teams to achieve up to 84%
efficiency gains and significantly faster settlement times. The company serves
major Swiss insurers including Mobiliar, Baloise, Dextra, and Coop Rechtsschutz,
and is expanding internationally.

## Background

As an AI-first company processing sensitive insurance data, amaise required a
cloud infrastructure that could handle complex AI workloads while maintaining
the flexibility to iterate quickly on their product. The team needed to focus on
developing their core AI capabilities rather than managing infrastructure, and
required a foundation that could scale with their growing customer base across
Switzerland and beyond.

Building AI pipelines that process thousands of pages of medical and legal
documents demands a robust, scalable architecture. At the same time, as a
startup, amaise needed to keep operational costs under control and minimize the
burden of infrastructure maintenance.

## Project Goals

The collaboration focused on establishing a solid technical foundation:

- Set up initial AWS infrastructure for applications and AI pipelines
- Design an architecture that minimizes operational overhead and costs
- Ensure flexibility to adapt as the product evolves
- Provide ongoing infrastructure reviews to maintain best practices

## bespinian's Role

bespinian supported amaise in building and optimizing their cloud infrastructure
on AWS.

### Initial Infrastructure Setup

We helped amaise establish their foundational AWS infrastructure for both their
customer-facing applications and their AI processing pipelines. By adopting a
serverless-first approach, we designed an architecture that automatically scales
with demand while eliminating the need to manage servers.

### Serverless Architecture

The serverless approach was central to the infrastructure design. This
architecture allows amaise's AI workloads to scale elastically based on
processing needs, whether handling a single document or thousands of pages
across multiple claims. When not in use, costs drop to near zero, making this
particularly valuable for a growing startup.

### Infrastructure Reviews

Beyond the initial setup, bespinian conducted multiple reviews of amaise's
infrastructure as their platform evolved. These reviews ensured that the
architecture continued to follow AWS best practices, identified optimization
opportunities, and addressed any emerging security or performance concerns.
