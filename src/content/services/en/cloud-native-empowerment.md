## The Challenges

Join us on the Cloud Native Empowerment journey if you face any of these
challenges:

- **Not Enough Time:** Do you want to modernize to modern cloud, but your teams
  are too busy with daily work?
- **Missing Skills:** Do team members lack know-how or experience with modern
  cloud computing?
- **High Costs**: Are your old apps and complex infrastructure driving up costs
  and taking too much of your engineers' time?
- **Slow Releases**: Do large, bulky apps and long release cycles stop your
  teams from quickly delivering key features to your customers?
- **Unsure Where to Start**: Are you not sure where to begin with all the modern
  cloud platforms, tools, and tech like Kubernetes, AWS, Azure, or GCP?

## Our Approach

We use an app-focused approach that combines modernization with culture change,
working side-by-side with your teams.

Our journey has three focused steps:

1. **Cloud Readiness Workshop**: We create a clear, ready-to-use app-first cloud
   plan that defines your ideal target setup and environment, backed by a full
   look at costs and benefits.
2. **Team Engineering**: Together, we modernize hands-on by putting your apps in
   containers, improving CI/CD, and adding monitoring to create a setup that
   scales and lets you build fast.
3. **Culture Change**: We help your teams adopt DevOps, GitOps, and Platform
   Thinking, building a culture of ownership and constant improvement for
   long-term success.
