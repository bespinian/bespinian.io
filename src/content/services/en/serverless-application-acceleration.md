## The Challenges

Join us on the Serverless Application Acceleration journey if you face any of
these challenges:

- **Too Much Operations Work**: Are your teams managing infrastructure instead
  of building features?
- **Wasted Costs**: Are you spending too much money on infrastructure that is
  rarely used or not for production?
- **Slow Releases**: Do long deployment cycles and complex infrastructure
  prevent your teams from quickly iterating and getting new features to market
  fast?
- **Scaling Problems**: Are your existing apps struggling to handle sudden load
  spikes?
- **Unsure Where to Use Serverless**: Are you not sure where and how to best use
  serverless tech without creating new problems like vendor lock-in, complex
  design, or "serverless sprawl"?

## Our Approach

We use an app-focused approach that blends strategic planning with hands-on
engineering, ensuring serverless tech delivers real business results. We work
side-by-side with your teams to create lasting change.

Our journey has three focused steps:

1. **Serverless Readiness Workshop**: We check your existing apps and goals to
   find where Serverless makes sense and where it does not. We check the best
   balance between speed, cost, and complexity to define a practical path
   forward.
2. **Serverless Engineering**: Together, we build or modernize your apps using
   the right serverless services, adopting the design patterns they need. We
   reduce operations and maintenance work, automating every step of the way.
3. **Team Training**: We help your engineers adopt the serverless mindset with
   confidence. Through coaching and hands-on support, your teams master
   event-driven concepts, automation, and operational best practices to become
   faster, more efficient, and self-sufficient.
