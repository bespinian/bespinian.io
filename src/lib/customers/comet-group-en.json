	"customer": "<a href=\"https://comet.tech/\" target=\"_blank\">Comet Group</a> is a Swiss company based in Flamatt employing more than 1700 people around the globe. They are a leading tech company driving innovation in the X-ray and radio frequency business. The division Comet X-ray develops and produces X-ray modules that enable non-destructive testing of materials and industry components. The inspected parts come from the aerospace, automotive, battery, semiconductors and other markets.",
	"background": "The X-ray modules, Comet has deployed with their customers worldwide, require regular maintenance. Knowing what exactly is going on within these devices and how they are being used is crucial for efficiently working with them. With targeted data visualization and preventive alerts, one can recognize patterns, drifts, gaps and detect incorrect usage and prevent outages. That is why Comet wanted to innovate in this space and create such a tool called BLOX for them and their customers.",
	"goal": "The goal of BLOX is to give Comet and their customers the big picture. Bringing in the transparancy and overview of displaying the metrics and data of each device in a way that is easy to understand and shows how the device has been used. Users can then investigate potential issues of the device by diving into different charts of a variety of metrics. They also receive warnings and alerts when the system detects unusual patterns and unexpected system states. bespinian and Comet are building BLOX in a tight collaboration and are very happy with how the tool already brings great value.",

		"intro": "bespinian played a key role in the following areas:",
		"topics": [
			{
				"title": "Infrastructure Setup",
				"body": "bespinian set up the infrastructure of BLOX by provisioning multiple separate environments into AWS using Terraform. Said infrastructure needed to be resilient, easy to maintain and cost-efficient. By choosing highly managed serverless technologies like AWS Lambda, Amazon DynamoDB or Amazon S3 for different parts of the application, much of the infrastructure setup and maintenance work could have been delegated to the cloud provider. Using infrastructure as code allows us to easily maintain multiple environments and make sure that we have parity among them."
			},
			{
				"title": "Backend Development",
				"body": "The backend of BLOX is the heart of the application and where all the business logic lies. It is written in Python because that's a well-known language to Comet, a first-class citizen on AWS Lambda, and provides us with the flexibility of performing small iterative changes. This is important because the business logic of how the logs and metrics from devices is interpreted is rather involved and complex at times. However, by using neatly structured and tested code, this complexity is well documented and automated in the BLOX backend code."
			},
			{
				"title": "Frontend Development",
				"body": "For the frontend rendered in users' web browsers, we decided to go for Svelte and Svelte Kit. Both are rather new but powerful technologies, which allow us to build a secure and performant browser application which is easy to use and easily accessible. For the hosting of this application, a combination of S3 and CloudFront was chosen. By doing so, BLOX is served in a very cost-efficient way and accessible to Comet and their customers around the globe."
			},
			{
				"title": "Monitoring and Alerting",
				"body": "Since the whole infrastructure is hosted on a large-scale cloud provider, it is a simple approach to use the monitoring, alerting, and logging tools they provide. In this case, we decided to go for Amazon CloudWatch, which collects the logs of the BLOX backend and triggers alerts if something goes wrong. By using these provided tools, we can make sure, the monitoring and alerting infrastructure itself is always available and provides a comprehensive feature set."
